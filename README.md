eLang is a programming language developed by Bekhruz Niyazov (it is still in development).

eLang is written in Python, but it is planned to be translated into C in the end of development.

ATTENTION! Current version (in C) is incomplete and buggy. For stable version download eLang 0.0.9 from Releases section.

# Installation
Just grab the latest release for your operating system from _releases_ section, add it to the path (recommended), and you are good to go.

# Quick overview of syntax

```javascript
function greet(name) {
	print("Hello,", name)
}
greet("eLang")
```
Output:
```
Hello, eLang
```
